## NC-News

NC News is a react application. It mimics a real news site, with similar formatting and functionality to existing forum sites such as Reddit. It contains articles on several main topics and can be sorted according to these. Articles can be viewed individually along with their comments, with both articles and comments able to be upvoted/ downvoted (and ordered according to these votes).

## Back-end Code :
https://github.com/IanJPeek/NC-News_Bend_Block_review

## Front-end Code :
https://github.com/IanJPeek/NCNewsflash2

## Deployed version :
https://nc-news-ianpeek.herokuapp.com

### Node requirement:
v12.10.0

#### To run:
1. Git clone the following link: https://github.com/IanJPeek/NCNewsflash2
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. You will be logged in as default user "jessjelly" - all comments left will be under this username and only comments attached to this username can be deleted.

## As a user I can ;

- View a list of all articles
- View a page for each topic, listing all articles associated with that topic
- View an individual article
- View comments on each individual article
- Sort articles by: date created (most recent), number of comments, and number of votes
- Sort an individual article's comments by number of votes/ when created.
- Post comments as "jessjelly" (the default user)
- Delete your own comments (jessjelly's)
- Upvote or downvote articles and see the corresponding vote change (this can be undone/ changed within +/- 1 range)
- Upvote or downvote comments and see the corresponding vote change (this can be undone/ changed within +/- 1 range)

- The site can be viewed on mobiles without loss of style or functionality
- Error messages are displayed for common errors (eg 404 for non-existent article/ path/ topic; 400 for invalid article ID)  or a default error message displays for others.






This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
